      <h4>About me:</h4>
      <div class="columns">I am a Senior at Eastern Washington University. I am a Technical Communications major. Originally I came to Eastern to be a poet. This is one of two schools in the state that offers an emphasis in poetry as part of a major. I quickly realized that
        even though poetry is my true gift and passion I probably would not make enough money to support myself being a poet, so I changed majors and joined the ranks of hopeful Technical Communications majors that will be graduating in the Spring of
        2014.</div>

        <div class="columns">I just moved into my first apartment. For the first time since I began college I have an oven at my disposal, a clean shower, and a living room! I have a flat mate and it is as difficult to adjust to as everyone warned me that it would be, but
          we seem to be getting along pretty well.</div>

      <div class="w-col w-col-6">
        <div class="columns">I also got a pet fish. Her name is Hubert Fitzgerald. She is a Beta fish and she lives in a hydroponic fish tank that grows herbs that I can cook with on top of it as well as maintaining and clean, sustainable ecosystem for Hubert Fitzgerald to
          live in. I am quite excited about my newest experiment.</div>
